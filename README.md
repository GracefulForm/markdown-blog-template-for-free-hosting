# Markdown Blog Template for Free Hosting

This quick starter template shows how you can make your own minimalist blog or website using markdown and host it for free on places such as: 
* Simplenote
* GitHub
* pen.io
* pastebins
* private bins
* etc.

Since GitHub uses markdown, you can view the template and see how it makes a clean and simplifed page.

See https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax for a simple markdown reference guide.
