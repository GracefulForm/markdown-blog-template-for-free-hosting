## Driving Through Vail
![](http://i46.tinypic.com/2dbnsxw.jpg)

Yesterday we drove through the Vail pass on our way to Denver. The roads were clear enough to drive on, but the temperature after sunset was below 18F and dropping!

We made it to Denver just in time to relax in a hot tub before getting some much needed rest.
